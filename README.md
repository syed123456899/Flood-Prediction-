Feature Engineering to add more features in dataset
then apply Corelation Coefficent techniques to take features that are linearly related with target 
Use of 5 Machine Learning Algorithms Random Forest,XG BOOST,GAUSSIAN NB,KNN AND DECISION TREE
USE OF 4 DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS MLP,RNN,ANN AND LSTM
to check which algorithms perform better on dataset 
evalute performance metrics
